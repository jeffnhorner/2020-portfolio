        longDescription: 'Take Split was a scooter ride share company based out of Los Angeles, CA. They contracted me for a short period of time to build out a new online step-by-step process for new potential Take Split drivers. My work on this was solely from a frontend perspective since the backend architecture was never fully fleshed out due to the company unfortunately shutting down during the early months of the global pandemic.',

This was ultimately the motivation behind the new application flow since Take Split would own the frontend and backend code. As I mentioned above, the backend was never built out, however, in addition to the API layer, the plan was going to build a custom admin so Take Split employees could manage/review the submitted applications.',
        'theStack': "Take Split's CEO gave me full control over what tech stack I could to quickly and elegantly build out the frontend. The decision to use Vue (Gridsome to be more specific) was a no brainer since 1) I was passionate about Vue as a reactive Javascript framework, 2) I'm pretty proficient with Vue considering I've used it professionally for almost 2 years now, and 3) I could get the prototype up quickly to present to the CEO and his team. He also gave me freerange of the design and since I do have a bit of design under my belt, this was an exciting project to work on.",
